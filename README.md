# Project: Smart Calculator
### About:
Calculators are great help: everyone is familiar with them. Why not write one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, multiplies, but also is smart enough to remember your previous calculations.
### Learning outcomes
Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about arrays, stacks, strings, and queues. You will also get a closer experience with BigInteger class that allows storing large volumes of data with precision for geo-data or physical quantities.
### This project is a part of the following learning goals:
Kotlin Developer
## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
### Stage 1/8: 2+2
Your calculator is taking the first steps: teach it to calculate the sum of two integers and display the result on the screen.
### Stage 2/8: 2+2+
Enable your calculator to keep adding the numbers on a loop until the user presses “exit”
### Stage 3/8: Count them all
With the help of arrays and strings, make it possible to calculate sums of multiple integers.
### Stage 4/8: Add subtractions
Where there is a plus, there is a minus. Using your knowledge of arrays and strings, enable to calculator to deal with subtraction as well as addition.
### Stage 5/8: Error!
There’s no math without errors: teach your program to notify the user about errors in case of invalid input.
### Stage 6/8: Variables
Working with Map class, enable the calculator to use variables as well.
### Stage 7/8: I've got the power
Time to upgrade and add even more possible operations: multiplication, division, powers and calculations in brackets.
### Stage 8/8: Very big
Get to know BigInterger class in order to manipulate big, large, long integers in calculations.
